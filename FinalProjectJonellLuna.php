				<h3> Forest Fires </h3>
				<p class = "description">
				
					A forest fire or wildfire, is an uncontrolled fire that rapidly spreads across vegetation and forest areas fueled 
					by dry conditions, strong winds, andd an excess of combustible material. Forest fires greatly affect us as they can 
					cause various issues to people living nearby or people who may be passing by. Sometimes these fires are caused by humans, 
					and we want to try to raise awareness against that so our forests can stay safe.

				<h3> Contamination </h3>
				<p class = "description">
					
					Contamination can happen in any area, it can be on neighborhoods, rivers or oceans and these affect our environments and even
					the animals that live in these habitats. One that comes to mind more recently is the contamination of our oceans, affecting
					all life on the sea, which is one of the reasons why we should try to recycle our garbage properly so it doesn't end up damaging
					our ecosystems.
