# backend-website
Welcome, this was a university project where I gathered valuable information regarding backend websites!
This is fully utilizing HTML and PHP, CSS is also included but was not the focus for me as such it will be a bit lackluster.

This project is fully connected to MariaDB and is also utilizing SQL to return various things the user would want such as viewing the website visitors.
It also utilizes SQL to allow the viewer to enter their information if they so choose and it will store everything on the backend database.
Multiple checks were put in place for this to make sure every field was answered properly and no rogue information would be inserted into the database (or no information at all for that case too).

As I said this is a university project many things might look rough around the edges but I am very proud of how it turned out!

I hope to focus on more backend future projects or maybe even fullstack as well!
